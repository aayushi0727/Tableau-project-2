# Tableau-project-2


A Tableau Dashboard visualising global expenditure and access trends across four key sectors: fuel, communication, internet, and health.

Fuel: A world map highlights countries based on their fuel exports as a percentage of merchandise exports. Darker shades represent higher export percentages, with some countries (like those in the Middle East and Russia) standing out as major fuel exporters.
Communication: A vertical bar chart shows the average number of fixed telephone subscriptions over time (2008â€“2018), with 2014 marked distinctly. This trend gives insight into the decline or growth in landline usage.
Internet: A horizontal bar chart compares the percentage of individuals using the internet across different countries. Northern European countries like Iceland, Norway, and Sweden show very high internet penetration, nearing or exceeding 90%.
Health: A scatter plot compares life expectancy at birth (y-axis) versus the percentage of the population aged 65 and above (x-axis). The size of each bubble represents current health expenditure, and colors indicate regions. Countries like Qatar, Bolivia, Russian Federation, and Eswatini are labeled for reference, showing diversity in health outcomes and expenditures globally.
Overall, this dashboard gives a comparative global overview of energy reliance, communication trends, digital access, and healthcare indicators.
